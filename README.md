# A Rusty Kaleidoscope
- Following the [Kaleidoscope Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) by the [LLVM Project](https://llvm.org/).
- Using Rust as the language frontend parser to build the AST.
- Including some differences in syntax for my own experimentation.
